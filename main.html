                    I commenced my secondary education in 2011 at Gothami Balika Vidyalaya in Colombo. 
                    Initially, I was not considered a particularly high-achieving student.

                    I am proud to share that I performed well in both my O-level and A-level examinations, and I hold a deep sense of gratitude for my alma mater for the role it played in my academic journey.
